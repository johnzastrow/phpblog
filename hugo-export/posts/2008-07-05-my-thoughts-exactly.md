Frankly, I think this is bull and it represents a growing frustration  
of mine over corporate greed and their ability to hijack our laws for  
the benefit their own interests through sludgehammer oppression of the  
free expression and creativity of the Amerian people. Everyone just  
grow up AND THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE PAST THE NEXT FISCAL QUARTER.

SunnComm Says Pointing to Shift Key &#8216;Possible Felony&#8217;

Earlier this week, a computer science graduate student at Princeton  
wrote a report showing the DRM was ineffective &#8211; it could easily be  
defeated by use of the &#8216;shift&#8217; key.** The stock of the DRM company (SunnComm) has since fallen by 20%. **Now,  
SunnComm plans to sue the student under the DMCA and claim that  
SunnComm&#8217;s reputation has been falsely damaged. According to SunnComm&#8217;s  
CEO, &#8216;No matter what their credentials or rationale, it is wrong to use  
one&#8217;s knowledge and the cover of academia to facilitate piracy and  
theft of digital property.'&#8221;**

This is bullshit, just like the parents sueing a school for installing  
a wireless network. The people in this country (USA) need to get a  
\*censored\*ing life or a job or something. I swear to God, all anyone  
knows how to do here is call their frickin lawyers. People need to stop  
sueing everyone for every little thing, and stop trying to act like  
their precious intellectual property is more important than the people  
paying them to use it. Boycott is not the answer either, I normally am  
not for government regulation but we need to make these things a real  
issue for the American public otherwise they will keep electing idiots  
that don&#8217;t tell the RIAA/MPAA to \*censored\* off. Most people over 40  
have no clue what the DMCA is or what an MP3 is or even that the RIAA  
and MPAA are pulling this bullshit. Every time I turn on CNN all I want  
to do it walk up to someone new and say, no, you can&#8217;t \*censored\*ing  
sue for that, and for being so damn dumb I&#8217;m going to punch you in the  
head until you pass out. GRRR!&#8221;
