Logged into source host

scp -r -p * root@remotehost:/home/user/public_html

This will copy \*all\* files to the directory /home/user/public_html in the remote server remotehost. The -p preserves the modification and access times, as well as the permissions of the source-file in the destination-file. The -r copies the contents of the source-file (directory in this case) recursively.
