In my opinion you can&#8217;t beat UMN Mapserver or Mapnik for making gorgeous online maps. Mapserver has installed and run for me flawlessly every time I&#8217;ve tried it &#8212; without days of arguing with it. Mapnik has taken me nearly a week to get running sometimes. But, just like you wouldn&#8217;t want to shovel snow with a pitch fork, &#8212; always use the right tool for the right job. Mapnik is a focused tool for quickly turning geographic data (think shapefiles) into good looking static images (tiles) for serving to modern internet tiling maps.

If you need something like this (and a few other things) then read this excellent article.
