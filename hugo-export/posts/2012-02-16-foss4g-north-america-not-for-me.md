After missing the International FOSS4G in Denver (one of my former homes and a great excuse to visit land and friend alike) I&#8217;m now likely going to miss <a href="http://foss4g-na.org/" target="_blank">FOSS4G North America</a> in the territory of my home office in the greater DC area. Argg, this totally bums me out. Somebody take good notes&#8230; and get me a T-shirt!
