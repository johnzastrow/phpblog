title: Cheap Oracle to MySQL Sync

Recently I had to set up Cheap (free) sync between an Oracle transactional database and an external MySQL for reporting. Luckily I didn&#8217;t need true replication (real-time or near real-time) I just needed to copy the contents of some Oracle tables and views to MySQL so that other people could read them without screwing up the Oracle data. If I had lots of money and higher requirements I could have used some dedicated commercial utilities like these big boys <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/goldengate/overview/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle GoldenGate </a> , <a href="http://www.quest.com/shareplex-for-oracle/ " target="_blank">Quest/Dell Shareplex</a>  , https://docs.continuent.com/wiki/display/TEDOC/Replicating+from+Oracle+to+MySQL) . I did try some smaller utilities but none of them worked or were too annoying. So I fell back on my favorite MySQL tool – SQLyog by Webyog https://www.webyog.com/. This little gem is the best MySQL desktop tool I’ve seen and totally worth the <$200 (I’ve been maintaining it for years).

&nbsp;

I use SQLyog for a lot of things including documenting existing databases that never had any design done – or designing new ones. I also use the little automated backup agent it includes to regularly backup my personal work (because relying on remembering to backup is recipe for disaster and anything more hardcore is too much). But in this case I am using a little executable called sja.exe it comes with to handle my automated Oracle to MySQL copying (syncing and replicating may too strong words here).

&nbsp;

Now, for the record what I’m describing here is a Poor Man’s, bubble-gum and duct-tape approach – not to be used in a mission-critical situation of course. But, it’s basically free and free of programming (I almost tried my hand at some Perl DBD utility, but I needed something I could knock out in a couple hours). Also, since it relies on Windows ODBC (yep, not gonna work on Linux) it can suck data from any ODBC-capable database and send it to MySQL.
