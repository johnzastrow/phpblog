I&#8217;ve got photo and media files spread across years of hard drives and constantly coming from multiple sources. So, I recently tried to consolidate a lot of the items as duplicates and other issues were clogging up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Synology-DiskStation-Diskless-Attached-DS214play/dp/B00FWUQNDQ" target="_blank">NAS</a>.

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  <span style="color: #808080;">As an aside lately I&#8217;ve been using <a style="color: #808080;" href="http://www.mjbpix.com/" target="_blank">PhotoMove 2 Pro</a> to move photos off of little media and into folders by date (from EXIF or file date for the older stuff), and then <a style="color: #808080;" href="https://www.goodsync.com/" target="_blank">Goodsync</a> to backup and sync files to the NAS. Soon I&#8217;ll start backing up offsite again, but I wasn&#8217;t in love with CrashPlan or Backblaze so I&#8217;m in search mode again</span>.

<span style="color: #000000;">But one day I accidentally checked the wrong box and ended up copying a bunch of music into my currated photos-by-date folders. Now amongst all the .JPG and .CR2 files I&#8217;ve got a bunch of .MP3 and other sound formats. I don&#8217;t want them there and I want to cherry pick them out. </span>

Since I&#8217;m on Windows 1o now, I&#8217;m going to do with Ubuntu for Windows instead of my trusty Cygwin.

The following command showing the unique file extensions and the count of each &#8211; kinda like a select .. group by count in sql is the following:

<pre>find -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c</pre>
